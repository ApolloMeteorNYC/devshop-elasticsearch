# Adding ElasticSearch to an Existing Application

Here are project assets to help you get started adding ElasticSearch to your extant Meteor application. The top-level directory structure has the application in "simple-todos" and setup scripts in the "scripts" directory.

The "simple-todos" application has 4 versions at different stages of completion:

* [master branch](https://github.com/Meteor-NY/devshop-elasticsearch) - plain todos app with user authentication
* [elasticsearch-1-sync-users](https://github.com/Meteor-NY/devshop-elasticsearch/tree/elasticsearch-1-sync-users) - added syncing of user inserts and updates between mongodb and elasticsearch
* [elasticsearch-2-error-handling](https://github.com/Meteor-NY/devshop-elasticsearch/tree/elasticsearch-2-error-handling) - properly handle errors during sync
* [elasticsearch-final](https://github.com/Meteor-NY/devshop-elasticsearch/tree/elasticsearch-final) - final version with user search bar added to UI

If anyone would like to make the user search bar UI prettier, pull requests are definitely welcome!
